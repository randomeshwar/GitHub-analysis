# GitHub-analysis
Python code to analyse GitHub repositories and calculate the degree of superposition. The code is divided into two files one for getting data and the other for anaysing the data.
For each PullRequest created bykm-poonacha, when the pull request is accepted by the randomeshwar, a new pull request and a new push request event is created .. the new pull request event only updates the time of merger of the repos. Note that the new pull request and the  push event have the same time of creation (+- a few millisecs).

If a pullRequest is rejected. A new pullrequest event is created but no push event.
